      Dota 2
      <br>
      Dota 2 is my favorite Computer games. I played it since 2015, 
      <br>
      actually I played the dota 1 since 2013 the I switch to dota 
      <br>
      because it is more good in terms of animation and graphics. 
      <br>
      Also have more strategies.

      Mobile Legends
      <br>
      Mobile legends is my one of the favorite mobile games.
      <br>
      I started playing it since 2018. I like it because it is like dota 2
      <br>
      but more fast paced and simple. It has a good strategic games
      <br>
      that produce team works.
